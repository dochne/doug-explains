# Querying - a primer on SELECT

### Parts of a SELECT query - a primer

They've made it somewhat better than when I first ended up on the MySQL docs, but their [documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/select.html) is still somewhat... intimidating when you first come across it.

The important ones are really these:

#### SELECT

This controls what data is returned from the query; so, `SELECT title FROM book` will return an array that looks something like [['title' => 'To Kill a Mockingbird']]

#### FROM

The base table from which you want to
#### ... JOIN

#### WHERE

#### GROUP BY

#### HAVING

#### LIMIT
